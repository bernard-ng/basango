## Introduction

The **"Basango"** is a structured and scalable system of news articles sourced from major media outlets covering diverse aspects of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Designed for efficiency, this system enables the automated collection, processing, and organization of news stories spanning politics, economy, society, culture, environment, and international affairs.

This system is built to support large-scale text analysis, making it a valuable resource for researchers, journalists, policymakers, and data scientists. It facilitates tasks such as sentiment analysis, trend detection, entity recognition, and language modeling, providing deep insights into the evolving socio-political and economic landscape of the DRC.

To ensure quality and reliability, the dataset prioritizes reputable news sources while maintaining an adaptable framework for continuous expansion. However, users are encouraged to critically assess the content, as journalistic standards and perspectives may vary.
